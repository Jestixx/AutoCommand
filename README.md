# AutoCommand
when this python script is runned it will open cmd(You can change the app later)  and type a command which is custumizable to your hearts content to what every you want.

There will be 2 versions of the file, One will be blank so you can change/add any of the code, And teh second will be an example file

To change the application do the following:
  At the 7th lien of code change the ("#ADD YOUR APP DIRECTORY") to any directory that your app is in.
  Then there will be lines of code like this 
    
    Keyboard.press('')
    Keyboard.release('')
  In the quotations add any letter do type or run a shorcut eg
  
    Keyboard.press('M')
    Keyboard.release('M')
  (Note, both of the letters should be the exact same)
  
  (Note, For enter you have to remove the quotes and replace it with (keyboard.enter))
  
  After than when you run the code it will work.
  
  If there are any problems comment and i may resolve
